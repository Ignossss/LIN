Satan has served Satanism well over the years, but everything has an end, in this case, the reign of satan is over, he is no longer as effective as he was in 1970s. We need a new symbol for what we used to call Satan, which symbolised opposition, or rebelion, and rationality, or nature; THE DEVIL HAS ASCENDED FROM TO HELL STORM OUR SOULS.

People most often have mistaken him for the DEVIL. So why not unleash the potential that Satan had? Let's set free the Lord of Blaspheme himself!

Everything will be the same except one fact: We shall aspire to be akin to him.
>[!important] Man is still an animal

Contrary to how he desires to perceive himself, man still is an animal, concealing this truth with terms such as 'emotion.' With his imperfect intelligence, he still places himself above other creatures - forgetting the fact that he is also one of them!

Man, as an animal, enjoys recreation, desiring day, and night in accord with his nature. But there exist individuals who are unable to enjoy themselves due to limitations or their inabilities, developing contempt for those who can; Their harmful ideas eventually has spread to many people who otherwise were very recreational.

But there must be no shame in indulgence, for it is all natural, and essential for a healthy body, and free mind. On the other hand, compulsion, which is created either by inability, or unwillingness to ingulge, only disturbs the individual. 

Accept your nature!x
